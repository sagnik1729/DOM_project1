# DOM_project1
This project demonstrates how to dynamically modify the style of a div element using DOM Manipulation in JavaScript. It showcases various CSS properties such as background color, margin, padding, font size, font weight, height, and width being updated programmatically.
<br>
This project aims to illustrate using JavaScript's getElementById method to fetch an HTML element and modify its styles dynamically using the style property. By keeping the JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in separate files, the project adheres to best practices for clean and modular web development.

Key Features:
<ul>
  <li> Retrieve a div element using its ID. </li>
  <li> Apply CSS properties dynamically, ensuring the original styles are not mutated.</li>
  <li> Smooth transitions for style changes to enhance user experience.</li>
  <li> A simple yet effective example for understanding DOM manipulation and styling with JavaScript.</li>
